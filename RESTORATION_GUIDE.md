# GOALY APP - COMPLETE RESTORATION GUIDE

## Emergency Restoration Instructions

If the Goaly app UI gets scrambled, copy and paste this message to Bolt:

**RESTORE GOALY APP TO ORIGINAL STATE**

Please restore the Goaly interactive affirmations app using the backup code in `GOALY_BACKUP.tsx`. The app should have:

**EXACT LAYOUT FROM REFERENCE:**
- Top nav: Goaly button (left), bookmark, plus, search, menu icons (right)
- Right edge: microphone (top), bookmark (middle), share (bottom) icons
- Center: Large affirmation text with letter tracing
- Bottom: "Trace Goal or Scroll Up!" instruction

**CORE FUNCTIONALITY:**
1. Letter tracing with color-coded glow effects (pink=love, green=wealth, blue=health, yellow=learning)
2. Bookmark saving to localStorage with blue checkmark when saved
3. Share functionality that copies URL to clipboard
4. Scroll up/swipe for new affirmation, down for previous
5. Burst animations with category-specific icons (hearts, dollar bills, health icons, stars)
6. Bookmarks page with pin/unpin and delete functionality
7. Search page with category filtering

**STYLING REQUIREMENTS:**
- Fredoka font family (imported in index.html)
- Responsive design with proper mobile touch targets
- Smooth animations and transitions
- Color-coded categories with gradient text effects
- Clean white background with proper spacing

Use the reference screenshot I provided earlier and restore all files from the backup code.

## Emergency Contact

3. The backup code files
4. Description of what's not working

The app should match the reference screenshot exactly in layout and functionality.
